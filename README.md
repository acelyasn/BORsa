# BORsa
This is my currency exchanger discord bot. 
- Supports exchange from any currency 
- Supports slash commands*
- Shows all TRY based currency values (for now)  

## Commands
```bor change``` (a number) (from currency) (to currency) -- should be all capital letters: Exchanges a value of a given currency to the other given currency.

```bor help``` : shows all the commands

### TRY based commands
*For now, all the slash commands are TRY based 

For now, embed colors change accordingly with the change of values only for these commands. (e.g., if there's an increase, embed color = green)

```/borsa``` : Shows all TRY based currency values

```/dt``` + value : Exchange from a USD value to TRY

```/et``` + value : Exchange from a EUR value to TRY

```/zt``` + value : Exchange from a PLN value to TRY

### examples 
 - ```bor change```
