## Commands

```bor help``` : shows all the commands
## Slash Commands
- ```/borsa``` : Shows 11 different exchange rates for the given currency type. TRY based embed is slightly different, it is indicated how the value changed (e.g., if the value has increased, there will be a green mark next to it)
- ```/cs``` :  Shows the currency codes of most used 7 currencies. The title of the embed is a link to the full list.

For now, embed colors change accordingly with the change of values only for these commands. (e.g., if there's an increase, embed color = green)

- ```/dt``` + value : Exchange from a USD value to TRY
- ```/et``` + value : Exchange from a EUR value to TRY
- ```/zt``` + value : Exchange from a PLN value to TRY
